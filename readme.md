# PHP-Docco

Original Pocco is found here: [http://fitzgen.github.io/pocco/](http://fitzgen.github.io/pocco/).

Pocco is a PHP port of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) tweaked to work better with PHP.

This clone adds back the better styling of Docco, but keeps the benefits of Pocco's syntax highlighting.

Read Pocco's own [generated annotated docs](https://rawgithub.com/jtsternberg/PHP-Docco/master/Pocco.html).
