# PHP-Docco

Original Pocco is found here: [http://kib2.free.fr/Pocco/Pocco.html](http://kib2.free.fr/Pocco/Pocco.html).

PHP-Docco is a clone of Pocco which is a PHP port of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) tweaked to work better with PHP.

PHP-Docco adds back the better styling of Docco, but keeps the benefits of Pocco's syntax highlighting. Confusing? Yah, I know.

Read Pocco's own [generated annotated docs](https://rawgithub.com/jtsternberg/PHP-Docco/master/Pocco.html).
